# JobAppsAPI

## About
This API allows users to determine whether a job application meets a minimum set of minimum qualifications.

The qualifications will be a list of question ids, each associated with a list of acceptable answers. If an application fails to answer any one of these questions with an acceptable answer, the application should be rejected. Otherwise the application should be accepted. The employer should be able to view only the accepted applications.
